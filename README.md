# About This Repo
This repo is a collection of documents about Linguistics Olympiad written by me.

Most in Chinese I guess.

## About Checkout
As you can see this is rather a collections of small projects. 
You may be more interested in only one or two directories. 
Since check out partial repo is impossible in Git, you need SVN:

```
svn export https://github.com/notcome/About-Linguistics-Olympiad/trunk/interesting-directory
```

## About Compilation
Though most people are only interested in the result PDF,
you may need to modify and therefore recompile everything.

I use [Computer Modern Unicode](http://cm-unicode.sourceforge.net) for IPA.

Other fonts. Well, with a modern OS X (Mavericks for IOL 2014 Analysis for example),
I guess everything would be OK. Ohterwise, rechoose fonts wouldn't be hard either,
for all definitions are put at the head of main file.
